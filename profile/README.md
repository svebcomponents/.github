## Building Web Components with Svelte

Building a one-off web component with Svelte is as easy as setting `customElement: true` in your Svelte config.

However, once you get into building a library of components boilerplate and configuration quickly add up and the developer experience is not as good as it could be.
`Svebcomponents` is a collection of tools that aim to smoothen the rough edges of building web components with Svelte.

I gave a talk on web components at Svelte Summit 2025, so feel to give it a watch if you'd like to learn more!
